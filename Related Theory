// Problem Statement:
// Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, find the k-th smallest element in the combined sorted array.
// The overall run-time complexity should be O(log(min(m, n))).

// Theory:
// The goal is to partition the two arrays such that the left partition contains the k smallest elements.
// Using binary search, we adjust the partition point until we find the k-th smallest element without explicitly merging the arrays.

// Time Complexity:
// O(log(min(m, n))) - Binary search is applied on the smaller of the two arrays.

// Space Complexity:
// O(1) - No additional space is used apart from a few variables.
